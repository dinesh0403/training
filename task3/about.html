        <div class="introabout">
            <h3>Watchy Watch was launched in 1998 and became an independent urban youth brand in 2005. Since then, it
                has carved a niche for itself with watches and sunglasses that are both fashionable and affordable.
                Watchy Watch extended its footprint into accessories in 2009 with a range of bags, belts and wallets.
                Watchy Watch retails across the nation through 158 exclusive Watchy Watch stores in over 79 cities as
                well as authorized multi-brand outlets and online (www.WatchyWatch.in). Today, the brand has
                successfully notched up the title of being the most loved youth fashion brand in the country.

                
                Watchy Watch’s Positioning
                Watchy Watch is India’s foremost youth accessories brand. It is sporty and coed. It believes that it is
                all about range and delivers just that in almost ungodly quick cycles. The brand stays focused on its
                audience and delivers what they want before they even know they want it. Watchy Watch is accessible and
                owns the playing field. It is not cheap, just affordable. It is not just about fashion but rather,
                lifestyle. It does not make products that are meant to be collectibles or those that will turn into
                heirlooms. It does not just make watches. It is not the manufacturer of tween gear. Watchy Watch
                accessorizes the youth… it makes what is their war paint and marks of individualism; it represents,
                articulates and stands for all they have to say.
